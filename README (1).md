# Face Recognition Tracking Attendance

'Face Recognition Tracking Attendance with Deep Learning using Python' in  which  we will create an Attendance project that will use a webcam to detect faces and record the attendance live in an excel sheet, Python Deep Learning based Face Detection, Face Recognition, Emotion , Gender and Age Classification using all popular models including Haar Cascade, HOG, SSD, MMOD, MTCNN, EigenFace, FisherFace, VGGFace, FaceNet, OpenFace, DeepFace.



Face Detection and Face Recognition is the most used applications of Computer Vision. Using these techniques, the computer will be able to extract one or more faces in an image or video and then compare it with the existing data to identify the people in that image.


 we will create an Attendance project that will use a webcam to detect faces and record the attendance live in an excel sheet.
